Hello! I hope you're doing well. I'm thrilled that my navigation header component is useful to you.

Component Introduction:
This code represents one of my first header components I've carefully crafted it with:

✔ Pure CSS implementation
Optimal structure and elegant organization.

Key Features:
✔ Responsive Behavior (Adapts to screen resizing and mouse interactions)
✔ Glass Border Effect (Frosted glass aesthetic)
✔ RGB Search Hover (Dynamic color transitions)
✔ Minimalist UI Elements (With subtle yet distinctive hover states)

Closing:
I hope you enjoy working with it! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
